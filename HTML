<h1>What's making our Christmas days 70 degrees?<h1>
<p>It's finally Christmas. It feels like eternity! You excitedly meet your family, chat, socialize, and take the opportunity to get to know each other even better. As Christmas dinner is being prepared, you go outside to catch a breath from all the commotion. In your tank top, flip-flops, and sports shorts! Your mom is using the barbeque for the dinner and your nephews are in the backyard pool! You sit back and remember what it was like to have snow on Christmas. Why was all this craziness happening?<p>

<h2>Up We Go...<h2>
<p> As you may have just now read, the global temperature has been steadily rising over the past few years. This is because of global warning. According to climatecentral.org, "2020 was 2.25°F (1.25°C) over the 1881-1910 baseline normal." That measily 2 degrees may not seem like a lot, but it has affected our thermometers greatly. An increase in temperatures always leaves us an increase in natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flash floods, and more. An example of this would be, in 2022 an estimate of 19 hurricanes will occur. However, in 1990 only 8 hurricanes have swept the world. That's almost double the amount of hurricanes. Your question still hasn't been answered. What is causing this global crisis?!<p>

<h3>Smokin' hot.<h3>
<p> Emissions. They're everywhere, they come form cars, busses, airplanes, trains. We inhale them, we exhale them. Do you wonder why most citizens of China wear masks? Because of the amount of emissions in the air. Ever wonder why cities look foggy and mushy in the distance? This is because of emissions. Smog is smoke that mixes with air particles to make a smoke - fog hybrid, smog. This is the comparasion between Atlanta on a red smog alert, and no smog in the sky.<p>
